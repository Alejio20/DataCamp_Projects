The 'Call' sales strategy has approximatly double the amount of customer purchases in the 'Email and call' sales strategy\n\n\n#### What does the spread of the revenue look like overall? And for each method?\nOverall, the majority of the revenue is under 150 for the six(6) months duration. The chart below shows a left skewed revenue distribution\n![Distribution of Revenue](sales2.jpg)\nFrom the box plot below, it will be observed that 'Call' sales strategy has the bulk of its revenue around 50 and slightly below and 'Email' strategy has the bulk of its revenue around 100 and slightly below accounting for highest revenue distribution while 'Email and Call' has the bulk of its revenue above 150 which has the least revenue distribution\n![Distribution of Revenue for each sales method](sales3.jpg)\n\n\n#### Was there any difference in revenue over time for each of the methods?\n![Distribution of Revenue for each sales method over time](sales4.jpg)\nIt will be observed from the above bar chart that the relationship of revenue distribution for each sales method over time is inversily correlated.
